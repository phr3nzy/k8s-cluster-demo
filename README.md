# K8s Cluster Demo

This is a demo displaying a Kubernetes cluster made up of a reverse proxy (nginx), a server (Express API) and a client (Svelte App).

This project is intended to show how easy it is to setup your own Kubernetes cluster, debug it, extend it with plugins and manage it.

Not much focus will go into the specific services themselves since that's not the main purpose of the project.
